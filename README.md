A Snake Game with GUI using Python's Tkinter Library

# 🐍 Python Snake Game (Tkinter GUI)


📖 Overview

This project is a classic Snake Game developed using Python and the Tkinter GUI library.
The game provides a graphical interface where the player controls the snake using keyboard keys, eats food, and grows in length while avoiding collisions.

This project was built as a learning-focused GUI game to practice event handling, canvas drawing, and game loops in Python.

🎯 Objectives  
 - Practice Python GUI programming using Tkinter
 - Understand event-driven programming
 - Implement basic game logic and collision detection
 - Work with animations using loops and delays
 - Build a fun, interactive portfolio project

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used  
 - Programming Language: Python
 - GUI Library: Tkinter
 - Graphics: Tkinter Canvas
 - IDE / Editor: IDLE

🚀 Features  
 - Graphical game interface using Tkinter
 - Keyboard-controlled snake movement
 - Food generation and score increase
 - Snake growth on eating food
 - Game-over detection on wall or self collision
